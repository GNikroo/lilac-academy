      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Lilac Alchemy is passionate about creating natural, homemade salves that
        promote wellness and healing. My journey started after years of working
        in the medical field and born from a love of nature. Through these
        salves, I share my knowledge and experiences with those who seek natural
        care and protection from harsh pharmaceuticals.
